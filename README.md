## 10 AI Agents in 14 Days â€“ JSON Pack

Iâ€™m building **10 AI agents in 14 days** and sharing their JSON configs here so you can use them directly in n8n.

---

## How to use

You have two simple options:

1. **Copy & paste**  
   Open the JSON file, copy the entire content, and paste it into n8n when creating/importing a workflow.

2. **Download & import**  
   - Click on the JSON file â†’ **Raw** â†’ Save as `<agent>.json`  
   - Import the file directly into n8n.

Thatâ€™s it. Your AI agent workflow will be ready to run inside n8n.
